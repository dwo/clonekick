Clonekick
=========

A [bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) for adding similar
events to [Songkick](http://www.songkick.com) quickly.

Adding many similar events (with the same lineup, or the same venue) to
Songkick can get boring. This bookmarklet allows you to "clone" the details of
the event you are viewing on Songkick into a new concert form.

To get the bookmarklet, visit http://dwo.github.io/clonekick/

Development
-----------

To create the minified version for use in a bookmarklet, install [YUI
Compressor](http://yui.github.io/yuicompressor/) and run `make`.
